 <h1>Bamdam's Movie Recommendations.</h1>

 <h2>My top 3 K-drama.</h2>
 <hr />
 
 <h3>Mr Queen</h3>
 <p>This is the story of a man who travelled back in time to the Joseon Dynasty but he found himself in a woman's body.<br/>
    It is purely comedy and I rate it 10/10.<br/>
 </p>

 <h3>Marry my Husband</h3>
 <p>This is the story of a woman who had a bad marriage but got a chance to go as far as 10 years back to correct the future. 
    (I guess I wish to travel back every once or twice, because I love time travel movies too much).<br />
    I rate the movie 9.5/10, there were some unnecessary scenes, hence my ratings.<br />  
 </p>

 <h3>What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?</h3>
 <p>
    This is no time travel stuff, but the comedy is on point.
    Especially with the boss' emphasis on his "aura"(watch and understand, 'laughs in the witchly way')<br />
    I rate it 9/10. Although, it is meant to be a romance movie but I didn't get the full romAance vibes.<br />
